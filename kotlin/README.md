# Soltera Kotlin Style Guide

The Soltera Kotlin Style Guide is a set of rules for writing Kotlin code.

We are using the official Kotlin styleguide for all of our Kotlin code, as this is already an existing standard and saves us some time. The Kotlin Android Styleguide is also of some relevance, as it mostly adheres to the language standard.
